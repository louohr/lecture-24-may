    <p>What is semantics? It's the convention of using the right HTML element at the right time and for the right
        purpose. So by using semnatic html we can explain to the developer what the specific element is used for.
        Here is some examples of the most common semantic HTML.
    </p>

    <h3>Section</h3>
    <section>This is a section. Represents a grouping of content, typically with a heading. It is
        used to divide the document into sections with related content.
    </section>
    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>Lorem impusm dodo hahak</p>

    <h3>Article</h3>
    <article>Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be independently distributed
        or reuse, such as a blog post or a newspaper article.
    </article>

    <h3 id="bg-yellow" class="bg-blue">Header</h3>
    <p>Contains introductory content of the webpage. It can also contain navigational links to
        different parts of the webpage or other pages.
    </p>
    <header>
        <h4>This is the amazing slogan!</h4>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Home Page</a></li>
                <li><a href="">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <h3>Nav</h3>
    <p>Represents a section of the document of the webpage that is intended for navigation links.</p>
    <nav>
        <a href="#">Link A</a>
        <a href="#">Link B</a>
        <a href="#">Link C</a>
    </nav>

    <h3 class="bg-blue">Aside</h3>
    <p>Represents content that is related to the content around it and could be considered separate or complementary.
    </p>
    <aside>This is the aside tag</aside>

    <h3>Block element vs Inline Element</h3>
    <p>Block element always takes the entire width of the page. That means there is no room for
        other elements on the same line, therefore the next element will be underneath.
        Examples are sections, articles, div, nav, header, and many more.</p>
    <p>Inline elements are the opposite, they only take up width that correspons to the width of
        the content of the element. Examples are a-elements and span-elements.
